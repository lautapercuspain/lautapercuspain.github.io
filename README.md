## I am Lautaro Gruss, a passionate Software Engineer .

I've had an interest in IT since I was 11 years old, where I started to study DOS. 
Initially, I explored technology through books and tutorials, then I went to an IT Institute, in Buneos Aires Argentina, to study Web and mobile development.
This institute [Educación IT](http://www.educacionit.com/) gave me the possibillity to master PHP and Javascript as my main program languages. Over the years, I became a teacher in the same Institute, teaching IT courses such us AJAX, PHP Services and PHP and MySql.
